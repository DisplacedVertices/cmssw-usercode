Since we are using the Tight WP, all others are dropped from the files in this directory, for readability. The columns are also organized for improved readability.

Note from these Twikis the following statement, which motivates the use of varying SFc/b and SFl separately:
Correlations between the SF measurements: SFlight is mostly uncorrelated to SFc and SFb, while SFc is conservatively taken as correlated to SFb. When varying SFb by +/- 1 sigma, one has to vary SFc by +/- 1 sigma simultaneously. SFlight can be independently varied by +/-1 sigma and the resulting uncertainty added in quadrature to that of SFc and SFb. The SF +/- 1 sigma are obtained by retrieving the "up" and "down" values as usual.
